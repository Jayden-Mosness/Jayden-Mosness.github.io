  <h2>My Hero<h2>  
<p>My hero is John F Kennedy, JFK was the only president to win a purple heart for his service in the United States Military during world war 2. I think that this is inspiring because JFK was the nations leader and who better to lead than someone that has been on the front line risking his life to defend his country.  </p>
<p>Another reason that JFK is my hero is becasue during his time as president he recorded conversations that happened inside the White House. I think that recording conversations was noble because it gave the people a real look into what was happening in the presidents office. With the way that media manipulates information this would have given an unbias look to what happens behind closed doors.</p>
