                <h3>The Staff:</h3>
                <p>The Avery Center staff is a dynamic group of survivors, researchers, full-time staff, volunteers, and
                    college interns, and there's
                    never a dull moment working on our team. We value independent thought, autonomous self-starters, and
                    anyone excited about making a difference.</p>

                <h3>How our last 2 years have gone:</h3>
                <p>After a six-month, intensive and intentional strategic planning process over the fall of 2019 and
                    into the spring of 2020, Free Our Girlsâ€™ board and executive staff collectively decided that a name
                    change and re-branding was necessary in order to communicate more inclusively to the ages and
                    genders of the survivors we walk alongside. This new brand also formally includes the academic
                    research, training, consulting, and policy advocacy work that our organization now performs.

                    Our research arm focuses on advocating and evaluating demand and harm reduction frameworks to
                    identify and hold accountable those that fuel exploitation, and to better identify, intervene, and
                    empower those who have experienced exploitation.

                    Our service arm focuses on economic empowerment-focused programs, such as financial literacy
                    curriculum and our Job Training Programs as well as peer support groups and basic needs resource
                    delivery. The majority of our direct services take place in a beautiful, century-old house in
                    downtown Greeley, where you'll also find our offices and Sparrow's Landing Boutique, our beautiful
                    resale shop filled with new and gently used unique items. </p>
