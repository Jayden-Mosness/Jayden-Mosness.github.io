        <h2>Sports Betting</h2>
        <p>Something that I personally find amusing is sports betting. I find this amusing because I enjoy watching sports but putting money on a game makes the game that much more fun to watch.  </p>
        <p>My favorite sports betting app is <a href="https://www.draftkings.com/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2F">DraftKings Sportsbook.</a> Draftkings is very user friendly and has a ton of different sports.</p>
        <h3>Investments</h3>
        <p>Another thing online that provides me with entertainment is investing in different companies on the stock market. I find this entertaining because I get to learn about all different types of companies and decide if there is a certain company that I feel can grow and increase the value of their stock so I can make some extra money.</p>
        <p>The investment app that I find the easiest to use is <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/go/join-fidelity-investments?imm_pid=700000001008875&immid=100742&imm_eid=ep6543813693&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIl6eR9ef18gIVwR-tBh0wdwWeEAAYASAAEgKEcfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Fidelity</a> and the app that I use the most to stay up to date on market infomation is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Finance.</a></p>
        <h4>Youtube Videos</h4>
        <p>I don't think that there is anyone that can say they haven't found themselves spending some time watching Youtube videos whether they are informational how to videos or just the weeks viral video. </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Here</a> is the link to Youtube I enjoy the watching the videos made by the youtuber Mr.Beast specifically his channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUaT_39o1x6qWjz7K2pWcgw">Beast Reacts.</a> What is your favorite youtuber?</p>
