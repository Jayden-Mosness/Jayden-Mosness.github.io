                    <h3>Political Implications</h3>
                    <P>The political implications of the long term stock exchange are that the stock exchange can
                        promote corruption. Some of the volatility of the stock market
                        involve the decisions of the government. If an elected offical knows about something that will
                        likly cause the stock of a corporation to increase substantially
                        before the news is released to the public then the poltician would be able to make a large chunk
                        of money.</P>
