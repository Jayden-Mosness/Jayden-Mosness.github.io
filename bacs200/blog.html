                    <h3>Social Implications</h3>
                    <p>The stock market is based on the confidece that people have in the market. If there are a lot of
                        people that feel like the stock market is going to crash
                        and pull their money out of the market causeing the market to crash. A stock market crash can
                        devastate economic growth which makes the stock price drop.
                        A lower stock price means that there is less wealth for the corporation, pension funds, and
                        indiviual investors. When the value of retirment funds decrease
                        significantly that reduces consumer spending.

                    <h3>Political Implications</h3>
                    <P>The political implications of the long term stock exchange are that the stock exchange can
                        promote corruption. Some of the volatility of the stock market
                        involve the decisions of the government. If an elected offical knows about something that will
                        likly cause the stock of a corporation to increase substantially
                        before the news is released to the public then the poltician would be able to make a large chunk
                        of money.</P>
